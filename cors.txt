Act like a lead experience UI developer who worked on React and CSS handling for Navigation, Accordion and css like transform translateX etc

You should read the code of Horizontal Navigation code in BuildingNavigation component which has icon-container with icon-right icon-left. This allow user to move the navigation left and right to see the navigation menu those are going out of page.

Since additional Navigation menu added for "Outdoor Air" and "Outdoor Water" the  Navigation going outside the page adding horizontal scrollbar to the page and not showing the icon-right.

You need to solve a UI navigation overflow issue.

Hint: "nav-container" children element are overflowing. Make the children within the parent container width so it will not overflow for max width of the screen.


I have undo the changes because the navigaiton went behind the custome-backdrop and also the navigation container started showing horizontal scrollbar instead showing icon-right. Make sure to take care of this and give proper fix.
